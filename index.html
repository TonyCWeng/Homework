        <li> 1 fresh small hot chili</li>
        <li> 2 to 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 tablespoons (15g) sweet Hungarian or smoked Spanish paprika</li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons (8g) whole or ground cumin seed</li>
        <li> 1 (28-ounce; 800g) can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li> Large handful minced cilantro, parsley, or a mix</li>
        <li> 6 eggs </li>
        <li> Sliced oil-cured black olives, feta cheese, or artichoke hearts, for serving (optional)</li>
        <li> Crusty bread, for serving</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large, deep skillet or straight-sided saut√© pan over high heat until shimmering.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add onion, red pepper, and chili and spread into an even layer. Cook, without moving, until vegetables on the bottom are deeply browned and beginning to char in spots, about 6 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir and repeat. Continue to cook until vegetables are fully softened and spottily charred, about another 4 minutes.
          </li>
          <li> Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, about 30 seconds. </li>
          <li> Add paprika and cumin and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Immediately add tomatoes and stir to combine. </li>
          <li> Reduce heat to a bare simmer and simmer for 10 minutes, then season to taste with salt and pepper and stir in half of cilantro or parsley.
          <li>
            Using a large spoon, make a well near the perimeter of the pan and break an egg directly into it. Spoon a little sauce over edges of egg white to partially submerge and contain it, leaving yolk exposed.
          <li> Repeat with remaining 5 eggs, working around pan as you go.
          <li>
            Season eggs with a little salt, cover, reduce heat to lowest setting, and cook until egg whites are barely set and yolks are still runny, 5 to 8 minutes.
          <li> Sprinkle with remaining cilantro or parsley, along with any of the optional toppings. Serve immediately with crusty bread.
        </ol>
